I am afraid your browser is not supported.

In fact, If you knew how Microsoft IE has been slowing web innovations by enforcing proprietary extensions, you would be wondering why is it still around... the answer can be summarize in word: "A MONOPOLY"

Fortunatly this monopoly is over. The web is growing so fast that M$ no other choices than updating
for so many years. One can wonder how come organizations
The point, this has changed. IE is no more - long life to Chrome and open standards.
